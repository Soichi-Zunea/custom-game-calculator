# Custom Game Calculator

How to Use.

First of all, this is incomplete.  I am trying to make a HTML/CSS/JS/PHP version of the code  within <code>java-code</code>.  The Main.java is the tester class, with the formula class holding all known/explored formulas for the specified game.  These are examples, at a later date I may hold the knowledge to allow the developer to insert a DAT or TXT file that has been separated in a designated manner to create corresponding formula methods, but until then, the developer must find their own formula and input it accordingly.

I shall describe the files and what they contain.

The do-not-go-to file contains a test to get the user's IP address, using PHP, and UserAgent, using PHP and JS.  Obvious from the files listed, the IP addresses and UserAgents are not stored.

The images file constains a specified game's images, cat pictures, the favicon, and a PDF that further explains/holds the formulas for the specified game.

The java-code file contains a class sequence, allowing for Object Oriented Programming to take place if someone wishes to use or modify the files.  It was made to be run locally. From Main -> Frame -> Game -> Category -> Subsection -> Calculator -> Formula.  Panel and WrapLayout are used to make the Custom Calculator look better.

The index, scripts, and styles files are tied together, basically creating a website version of the java code.

The tester file basically just holds a large table of in-game material.

I do not know when I will be able to work on this project further, hopefully during December/2023.
